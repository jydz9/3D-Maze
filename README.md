# 3D-Maze
Team Project: Create a 3D Maze in Unity

## Maze
Maze is generated with Recursive Backtracking
We have a 2D grid of nodes that are each surrounded by walls. We choose an arbitrary point to start with, then move to a neighboring node, taking down the wall between them. Repeat this process until we hit a dead end, then move backwards until you find a new unvisited neighbor and move to them

## UI
Use Mixamo for the animation 
  - Idle animation
  - Running animation

## Game Menu
Change the difficulty by changing the height and width of the maze
