# 3D-Maze
Team Project: Create a 3D Maze in Unity

## Maze
Maze is generated with Recursive Backtracking
We have a 2D grid of nodes that are each surrounded by walls. We choose an arbitrary point to start with, then move to a neighboring node, taking down the wall between them. Repeat this process until we hit a dead end, then move backwards until you find a new unvisited neighbor and move to them

## UI
Use Mixamo for the animation 
  - Idle animation
  - Running animation

## GamePlay Function
  - Find the goal in the maze within the time requirement
  - Time: Is set by the size of the height and width then divide by a certain number

## CAVE VR
  - Simple movement in the CAVE using the controller(Forward, Backward, left, right)
  - Use the controller to touch the goal(Destroy is the goal when the MVR touches the goal(
  
## Game Menu
Change the difficulty by changing the height and width of the maze
